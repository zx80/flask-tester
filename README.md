# FlaskTester - fixtures for Flask internal and external pytest tests

This package allows to run authenticated tests against a Flask application,
either with internal Flask tests (aka `test_client`) or external tests (with
`requests` which performs actual HTTP requests).

Only one set of tests is needed, switching from internal to external is
achieved through environment variables.

## Fixtures

The package provides two fixtures:

- `ft_authenticator` for app authentication, which depends on two environment variables:

  - `FLASK_TESTER_ALLOW` space-separated list of allowed authentication schemes.
  - `FLASK_TESTER_AUTH` comma-separated list of _login:password_ credentials.

- `ft_client` for app testing, which depends on the previous fixture, plus environment
  variables which allow to find the application, at least one must be defined.

  - `FLASK_TESTER_URL` URL of the running application for external tests.
  - `FLASK_TESTER_APP` package (filename with `.py`) to be imported for the application.
    - the application is expected to be named `app`
    - if not available, look and call for `create_app`

  The authenticator is available as `_auth` in the client fixture.

```python
import os
import pytest
from FlaskTester import ft_authenticator, ft_client

@pytest.fixture
def api(ft_client):
    # get Calvin's token, assume {"token": "<token-value>"}
    res = ft_client.get("/token", login="calvin", auth="basic", status=200)
    assert res.is_json
    ft_client._auth.setToken("calvin", res.json["token"])
    yield ft_client

def test_app(api):
    api.get("/admin", login="calvin", auth="bearer", status=200)
    api.get("/admin", login="calvin", auth="basic", status=200)
    api.get("/admin", login="hobbes", auth="basic", status=401)
```

Authenticator environment variables can be set from the pytest Python test file by
assigning them through `os.environ`.

## Classes

The implementation of these fixtures is based on four classes:

- `Authenticator` class to store test credentials.

  Use `setPass` and `setToken` to add user credentials.

- `Client` abstract class to run test, with two implementations.

  The class provides usual `get`, `post`â€¦ per-HTTP-method methods,
  and a more generic `request` method.

  These methods expect the following named parameters:

  - `login` for user login to use for authentication.
  - `auth` for the authentication scheme to use for this request,
    otherwise allowed schemes are tried, with tokens first.
  - `status` for the expected HTTP status code.

- `FlaskClient` implementation class for internal tests.
- `RequestClient` implementation class for external (real HTTP) tests.
