# FlaskTester - Pytest fixtures for Flask internal and external authenticated tests

This package allows to run authenticated tests against a Flask application,
either with internal Flask tests (aka `test_client`) or external tests (with
`requests` which performs actual HTTP requests), including password and token
authentication and per-user cookies.

Only one set of tests is needed, switching from internal to external is
achieved through environment variables.

## Usage

Install package with `pip install FlaskTester` or equivalent.

The following test creates a local fixture with 2 users identified by a
password, and retrieves tokens for both users using a `/login` route
provided by the application.
It then proceeds to run authenticated requests against the `/admin` route.

```python
import pytest
from FlaskTester import ft_authenticator, ft_client
import secret

@pytest.fixture
def app(ft_client):
    # add test passwords for Calvin and Hobbes (must be consistent with app!)
    ft_client.setPass("calvin", secret.PASSES["calvin"])
    ft_client.setPass("hobbes", secret.PASSES["hobbes"])
    # get user tokens, assume json result {"token": "<token-value>"}
    res = ft_client.get("/login", login="calvin", auth="basic", status=200)
    assert res.is_json
    ft_client.setToken("calvin", res.json["token"])
    res = ft_client.post("/login", login="hobbes", auth="param", status=201)
    assert res.is_json
    ft_client.setToken("hobbes", res.json["token"])
    # also set a cookie
    ft_client.setCookie("hobbes", "lang", "fr")
    ft_client.setCookie("calvin", "lang", "en")
    # return working client
    yield ft_client

def test_app_admin(app):
    app.get("/admin", login=None, status=401)
    for auth in ["bearer", "basic", "param"]:
        res = app.get("/admin", login="calvin", auth=auth, status=200)
        assert res.json["user"] == "calvin" and res.json["isadmin"]
        res = app.get("/admin", login="hobbes", auth=auth, status=403)
        assert 'not in group "ADMIN"' in res.text
```

This can be run against a (local) server:

```shell
export TEST_SEED="some-random-data"              # shared test seed
flask --app app:app run &                        # start flask app
pid=$!                                           # keep pid
export FLASK_TESTER_APP="http://localhost:5000"  # set app local url
pytest test.py                                   # run external tests
kill $pid                                        # stop app with pid
```

Or locally with the Flask internal test infrastructure:

```shell
export FLASK_TESTER_APP="app:app"                # set app package
pytest test.py                                   # run internal tests
```

The above test runs with [`tests/app.py`](tests/app.py)
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
REST application back-end with password and token authentication based on
[FlaskSimpleAuth](https://pypi.org/project/FlaskSimpleAuth/).
The code uses _25_ lines of Python for implementing
password (basic and parameters) and token authentications,
admin group authorization, and routes for
token generation (2), identity tests (2) and an incredible open cookie-based
translation service.
